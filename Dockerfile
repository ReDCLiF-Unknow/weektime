# Build: everything is pure Go (SQLite included), so CGO is off and the result
# is a static binary that needs nothing at runtime.

# The build stage always runs on the builder's own architecture and
# cross-compiles for the target, so multi-arch images build in seconds
# instead of crawling through emulation.
